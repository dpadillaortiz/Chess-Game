Project Brain Storm:
- local two player game
- all text; no images
	- ideally i would "draw out" the board using undersacores or whatever
	- realistically, it's 
		1. get a string of text telling me the position of the piece, 
		2. telling me if I'm check-ed, 
		3. through some command it'll tell me the position of player b's pieces
		4. give a command to move the piece to the appropriate coordinate
		5. confirm a kill
- i'd start with programming pawns > king > rooks > bishops > queen > knights
